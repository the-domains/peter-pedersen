We provide an essential link
between the UK IT Leadership community and the foremost Asian / EMEA
businesses.

The Council's mission is to provide IT
Leadership and advice to evolving and expanding businesses in Asia /EMEA with a
view to enhancing the UK IT service offerings whilst helping them to build and
establish their own organisations.

This establishes lasting
partnerships with private and public sector and organisations in the UK.

Intensifying global competition for
resources and the demand for high performance are pressing firms to become more
flexible, be more results-focused, and be fast-acting and better connected. 

There is an increasing realisation
of the importance of localised leadership advice from experienced leaders, who
can connect internationally, thereby optimising the impact on local businesses
and people.

This free membership service
provides UK leaders with:

Board level advisory opportunities
